| **CG Boost ‚Äî ‚ÄúBlender for Beginners‚Äù**                           | A well-structured 15-lesson course (\~5 hours total) that walks you through from the default cube to a full still-life scene. Covers UI, navigation, modelling, texturing, lighting, rendering. Very good for building confidence and understanding how things connect. ([cgboost.com][1])                                                                                          | Free on CG Boost: *Blender for Beginners* ([cgboost.com][1]) |
| **Blender Guru ‚Äî Donut Tutorial Series**                         | Perhaps the most famous starting project. Teaches many of the basics by building something concrete (a donut!). You‚Äôll learn modelling (mesh editing etc.), modifiers, materials, lighting, rendering. It‚Äôs hands-on and motivating because you end with something that looks finished. (Make sure to pick a recent version so the interface matches what you have.) ([YouTube][2]) |                                                              |
| **YouTube ‚Äî ‚ÄúBlender Quick Start Guide for Absolute Beginners‚Äù** | A shorter tutorial to get you off the ground: basic navigation, setting up Blender, understanding what the main parts of the interface are. Good for absolute beginner so you don‚Äôt get overwhelmed. ([YouTube][3])                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                              |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tips For Learning Blender Well

* **Follow along**: Don‚Äôt just watch ‚Äî pause, try the same thing in Blender. Doing is how you remember.
* **Use the same version**: If possible, use the version of Blender that the tutorial uses (or close) so the UI/tools match what you see.
* **Repeat small projects**: After finishing a tutorial, try to recreate it without the video. That helps internalize shortcuts/tools.
* **Focus on fundamentals first**: Navigation, selecting, transforming, modifiers, basic materials. These are used everywhere.
* **Don‚Äôt get discouraged by complexity**: Blender is deep. Early ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù or confusion are totally normal.

If you tell me what kind of 3D modelling you want (characters? environment? low poly? realistic?), I can pick tutorials more tailored for *you*. Do you want me to find some of those too?
