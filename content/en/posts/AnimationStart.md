#### An AI assistant was asked how to get started as an animator and here is the response!

🎬 1. Understand the Types of Computer Animation
There are a few main categories:

- 2D Animation (like traditional cartoons or motion graphics)
- 3D Animation (used in films, games, and simulations)
- Stop Motion (which might appeal to you as a sculptor)
- Motion Capture (used in realistic character animation)

🧰 2. Learn the Tools of the Trade
Here are some industry-standard tools to explore:

- For 2D Animation:
    1. Toon Boom Harmony
    1. Adobe After Effects
    1. Krita (free and open-source)

- For 3D Animation:
    1. Blender (free and very powerful).  
    Since Blender is free and covers modeling, rigging, animation, and rendering, it’s a great place to start.
    1. Autodesk Maya (industry standard, but expensive)
    1. Cinema 4D (great for motion graphics)
        

📚 3. Take Online Courses or Tutorials
Some great platforms:
- YouTube (tons of free Blender tutorials)
- Udemy (affordable, project-based courses)
- Coursera or edX (more academic, sometimes free)
- Animation Mentor or CG Spectrum (professional-level training)

🎨 4. Start Creating
+ Begin with small projects: bouncing ball, walk cycles, simple character rigs.
+ Share your work on platforms like ArtStation, Sketchfab, or Instagram.
+ Join communities like Blender Artists, r/animation, or DeviantArt.

🔁 5. Combine with Your Sculpture
You could even scan your sculptures and animate them digitally. That could be a unique niche for you!
