🎬 1. Understand the Types of Computer Animation
There are a few main categories:

2D Animation (like traditional cartoons or motion graphics)
3D Animation (used in films, games, and simulations)
Stop Motion (which might appeal to you as a sculptor)
Motion Capture (used in realistic character animation)
Would you like to focus on one of these?

🧰 2. Learn the Tools of the Trade
Here are some industry-standard tools to explore:

For 2D Animation:
Toon Boom Harmony
Adobe After Effects
Krita (free and open-source)
For 3D Animation:
Blender (free and very powerful)
Autodesk Maya (industry standard, but expensive)
Cinema 4D (great for motion graphics)
Since Blender is free and covers modeling, rigging, animation, and rendering, it’s a great place to start.

📚 3. Take Online Courses or Tutorials
Some great platforms:

YouTube (tons of free Blender tutorials)
Udemy (affordable, project-based courses)
Coursera or edX (more academic, sometimes free)
Animation Mentor or CG Spectrum (professional-level training)
Would you like me to find a good beginner course for Blender or another tool?

🎨 4. Start Creating
Begin with small projects: bouncing ball, walk cycles, simple character rigs.
Share your work on platforms like ArtStation, Sketchfab, or Instagram.
Join communities like Blender Artists, r/animation, or DeviantArt.
🔁 5. Combine with Your Sculpture
You could even scan your sculptures and animate them digitally. That could be a unique niche for you!
