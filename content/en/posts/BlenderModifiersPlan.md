### An AI agent was asked to find the top free tutorials and courses for learning sculpting and modifiers in Blender. Here is the response. 

Nice — sculpting and modifiers are two of the most fun (and useful) parts of Blender. Below I’ve picked **the best free, up-to-date** resources (playlists and single videos) and a short, practical learning path you can start today.

# Top free courses & tutorials (what to watch first)

1. **Blender Foundation — *Blender Fundamentals* (official)** — the canonical starter series that covers Blender UI, navigation, and core systems (includes modifier basics). Great to get comfortable with the interface before tackling sculpting workflows. ([YouTube][1])

2. **Grant Abbitt — *Sculpting in Blender: A Complete Beginner’s Guide*** — a clear, step-by-step sculpting course for beginners (brushes, workspace, dynamic topology, multiresolution). Excellent pacing if you’re brand new to sculpting. ([YouTube][2])

3. **YanSculpts (YouTube) — Sculpting demos & courses** — artist-led sculpting workflows, stylized and realistic character sculpts, great to learn artistic process, brush combos and finishing techniques. Use these once you know the basics. ([YouTube][3])

4. **Default Cube / CGMatter — practical modifier & workflow videos** — short, focused tutorials (and longer walkthroughs) that show real uses of modifiers and non-destructive modeling techniques. Great for learning modifiers beyond the basics and seeing clever workflows. ([YouTube][4])

5. **"All X Modifiers explained" / Modifiers-for-beginners videos** — concise overviews (e.g., “All 54 Modifiers in 10 Minutes” and “Modifiers for Beginners”) that map out what each modifier does and common use cases (mirror, subdivision, array, curve, boolean, remesh, multiresolution). Keep one of these as a quick reference. ([YouTube][5])

# Suggested short learning path (practical, 6 sessions)

1. Session A — **Blender fundamentals**: UI, navigation, object vs edit vs sculpt mode, basic mesh editing. (Blender Fundamentals). ([YouTube][1])
2. Session B — **Modifiers crash course**: Mirror, Subdivision Surface, Boolean, Array, Curve — follow a “modifiers for beginners” video and practice with a cube and cylinder. ([YouTube][6])
3. Session C — **Sculpt setup & brushes**: Start Grant Abbitt’s beginner sculpting guide — learn brushes, symmetry, Dyntopo vs Multiresolution, and the remesh workflow. ([YouTube][2])
4. Session D — **Sculpt a simple stylized head**: Follow a YanSculpts or Grant Abbitt follow-along; block shapes, refine, add features. ([YouTube][3])
5. Session E — **Combine sculpt + modifiers**: Create a base mesh with modifiers (mirror + subdivision), sculpt details, then use Multiresolution modifier or remesh workflow to preserve non-destructive edits. (Use Default Cube/CGMatter modifier examples). ([YouTube][4])
6. Session F — **Polish & next steps**: Learn basic retopology (if you want clean meshes), baking normals, and simple texturing. Use the earlier modifier and sculpt videos as needed.

# Practice projects (one-sentence each)

* Stylized head from cube → practice blocking + sculpting. (Good beginner sculpt project.) ([YouTube][7])
* Creature bust → practice organic forms and brush transitions (YanSculpts examples are great). ([YouTube][3])
* Repeating architectural detail (tiles, fence) using **Array + Curve** modifiers → practice non-destructive modeling. ([YouTube][8])

# Tips & quick references

* Use **Mirror + Subdivision Surface** for non-destructive base shapes; switch to **Multiresolution** or **Dyntopo/Remesh** for detail sculpting. (See Grant Abbitt + modifiers videos.) ([YouTube][2])
* Keep an “All modifiers” cheat video/playlist handy so you can look up a modifier’s purpose fast. ([YouTube][5])

If you want, I’ll do one of these right now:

* assemble a **4-week practice plan** (daily tasks + exact videos to watch), or
* create a **beginner playlist** (ordered links to the exact YouTube videos/playlists above) you can follow step-by-step.

Which would you like me to make now?
